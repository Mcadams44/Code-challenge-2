# Event Guest List Manager

This project is a simple Event Guest List Manager built using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. It allows users to dynamically add, update, and remove guest names from a list without refreshing the browser.

## Overview

In this code challenge, you'll practice the following JavaScript and front-end development skills:

- Handling forms and user input
- Dynamically updating the page using JavaScript
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Basic conditional logic and state control

## Code Structure

Your code should be organized in the following structure:


## Deliverables

Your application should provide the following features:

- Users can type a guest's name into an input field.
- Users can click a submit button to add the guest to the list.
- The guest's name appears in a list on the page after submission.
- Each guest entry includes a "Remove" button that deletes the guest from the list.
- The list should be limited to 10 guests. If the user attempts to add more, display an alert.
- Include a "Toggle RSVP" feature so that each guest can be marked as either "Attending" or "Not Attending".

You are free to create your own layout and styling. The goal is to meet the functional requirements in a clear and user-friendly way.

## Stretch Deliverables

After completing the required features, you may choose to implement additional functionality, such as:

- Categorize guests as Friend, Family, or Colleague using color-coded tags.
- Display the time when each guest was added to the list.
- Add an Edit button that allows users to change a guest's name.
- Implement any other custom feature that enhances the app's functionality or design.

## Testing and Debugging

This project is deliverable-driven and does not use automated testing. You are responsible for manually testing your application in the browser.

Use the following strategies to verify your code:

- Use `console.log()` to inspect variables and function behavior.
- Refresh the browser frequently as you build and modify your code.
- Interact with the form, buttons, and list elements to confirm the behavior works as expected.

## Getting Started

To get started:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Edit `index.js` and `style.css` to build and style your application.
4. Test your code by interacting with the form and checking console output.

## Conclusion

This project is a great way to build confidence in DOM manipulation and event-driven JavaScript. Focus on clean code, responsive interaction, and a functional user experience.
